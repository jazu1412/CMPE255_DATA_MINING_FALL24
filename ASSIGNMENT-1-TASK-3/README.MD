# Mental Health in Tech Survey Analysis

This project analyzes the "Mental Health in Tech Survey" dataset using Akkio, a no-code AutoML platform. The analysis aims to provide insights into the mental health landscape within the tech industry.

## Overview

Mental health is a critical issue in the tech industry, where high-stress environments and demanding workloads can lead to mental health challenges. This project uses the [Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey) dataset from Kaggle to understand various factors affecting mental health among tech professionals.

### Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)
- **Description**: This dataset contains responses from a survey conducted to assess the mental health of individuals working in the tech industry. It includes questions about mental health history, workplace attitudes towards mental health, and demographics.
- **Columns**:
  - `Age`: Respondent's age.
  - `Gender`: Respondent's gender.
  - `Country`: Respondent's country of residence.
  - `self_employed`: Whether the respondent is self-employed.
  - `family_history`: Whether the respondent has a family history of mental illness.
  - `treatment`: Whether the respondent has sought treatment for a mental health condition.
  - And many more...

### Objective

The goal of this analysis is to predict whether a person in the tech industry is likely to seek treatment for mental health issues based on various factors such as age, gender, family history, and workplace environment.
