## Overview

Mental health is a critical issue in the tech industry, where high-stress environments and demanding workloads can lead to mental health challenges. This project uses the [Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey) dataset from Kaggle to understand various factors affecting mental health among tech professionals.

### Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)
- **Description**: This dataset contains responses from a survey conducted to assess the mental health of individuals working in the tech industry. It includes questions about mental health history, workplace attitudes towards mental health, and demographics.
  
### Columns

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Timestamp**: The date and time of the survey response.
- **Age**: Respondent's age.
- **Gender**: Respondent's gender.
- **Country**: Respondent's country of residence.
- **state**: If the respondent lives in the U.S., which state or territory they live in.
- **self_employed**: Whether the respondent is self-employed.
- **family_history**: Whether the respondent has a family history of mental illness.
- **treatment**: Whether the respondent has sought treatment for a mental health condition.
- **work_interfere**: If the respondent has a mental health condition, does it interfere with their work?
- **no_employees**: How many employees does the respondent's company or organization have?
- **remote_work**: Does the respondent work remotely at least 50% of the time?
- **tech_company**: Is the respondent's employer primarily a tech company/organization?
- **benefits**: Does the employer provide mental health benefits?
- **care_options**: Does the respondent know the options for mental health care provided by their employer?
- **wellness_program**: Has the employer discussed mental health as part of an employee wellness program?
- **seek_help**: Does the employer provide resources to learn more about mental health issues and how to seek help?
- **anonymity**: Is anonymity protected if the respondent takes advantage of mental health resources?
- **leave**: How easy is it for the respondent to take medical leave for a mental health condition?
- **mental_health_consequence**: Does the respondent believe that discussing mental health with their employer would have negative consequences?
- **phys_health_consequence**: Does the respondent believe that discussing physical health with their employer would have negative consequences?
- **coworkers**: Would the respondent be willing to discuss a mental health issue with coworkers?
- **supervisor**: Would the respondent be willing to discuss a mental health issue with direct supervisors?
- **mental_health_interview**: Would the respondent bring up a mental health issue with a potential employer in an interview?
- **phys_health_interview**: Would the respondent bring up a physical health issue with a potential employer in an interview?
- **mental_vs_physical**: Does the respondent feel that their employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?
- **obs_consequence**: Has the respondent heard of or observed negative consequences for coworkers with mental health conditions?
- **comments**: Additional notes or comments from the respondent.

## Objective

The goal of this analysis is to predict whether a person in the tech industry is likely to seek treatment for mental health issues based on various factors such as age, gender, family history, and workplace environment.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Dataset**: Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey).
2. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
3. **Akkio**: Use the no-code AutoML platform Akkio to create predictive models based on the dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
5. **Insights**: Extract key insights from the model and interpret the results.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of no-code AutoML tools like Akkio to explore and analyze complex datasets, enabling users to gain actionable insights without requiring extensive coding skills. The "Mental Health in Tech Survey" provides valuable information that can help organizations better understand and address mental health issues in the workplace.
