# Stock Price Variation Prediction Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the "200 Financial Indicators of US stocks (2014-2018)" dataset using Akkio, a no-code AutoML platform for the financial year 2018 alone. The analysis aims to predict stock price variations based on various financial indicators.It tries to predict the future performance of a stock by looking at the financial information released in the 10-K filings  and also we have data on whether on the year 2019 , stock prices increased or not

The last column of the dataset represent the class of each stock, where:

if the value of a stock increases during 2019, then class=1;
if the value of a stock decreases during 2019, then class=0.

So we would be trying to predict this class column if its positive or negative based on 2018 financial data

## Dataset
**Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cnic92/200-financial-indicators-of-us-stocks-20142018)  
**Description**: This dataset contains 200+ financial indicators for US stocks for the period 2014-2018.  
**Columns**: Include various financial metrics such as Revenue, EPS, P/E Ratio, and many more.

## Objective
The goal of this analysis is to predict the "2019 PRICE VAR [%]" for stocks is positive or negative (derived on class column) based on the provided financial indicators for the year 2018 alone. This prediction can provide valuable insights for investment decisions to either buy or sell a stock.
